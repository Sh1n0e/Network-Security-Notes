# HackTheBox Journey

What have I learnt so far:
1. Using OpenVPN Files to be able to connect to the same network as whatever machine I am trying to find the flag from.
2. Using tools like nmap to be able to find exposed ports on any given network

Expanding upon point 2, HackTheBox so far has taught me how to exploit services like:
- Telnet
- SSH: Secure Shell
- FTP: File Transfer Protocol
- SMB: Server Message Block
- Redis: Remote Dictionary Server

I will follow-up with my understanding on each service below:

# Redis - Remote Disctionary Server

![RedisImage](img/Redis-Logo.png)

Redis is an open-source, in memory, multimodel database that works super fast.

- Is a system where Read and Write Operations happen quickly on RAM rather than the disk (which would be slower)
- Still utilizes the disk for storage to be reconstructed whenever needed.

Data within this database is stored in 2 parts: Key and Value (Value is self explanatory)

## Key 
Can be stored as a string, bitmap, bitfield, hash, list, set, sorted set etc. etc.

These are stored in a similar way any programming language would store a variable rather than having to make one or many tables to store any given data set.

## Basic Commands 

``` c#
SET <Key> <String> - Creates a Key with a STRING Value

GET <Key> - Reads data within a Key
```

Redis itself is able to act as a primary database.
