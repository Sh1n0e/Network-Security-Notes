# HackTheBox Journey

What have I learnt so far:
1. Using OpenVPN Files to be able to connect to the same network as whatever machine I am trying to find the flag from.
2. Using tools like nmap to be able to find exposed ports on any given network

Expanding upon point 2, HackTheBox so far has taught me how to exploit services like:
- Telnet
- SSH: Secure Shell
- FTP: File Transfer Protocol
- SMB: Server Message Block
- Redis

I will follow-up with my understanding on each service below:
