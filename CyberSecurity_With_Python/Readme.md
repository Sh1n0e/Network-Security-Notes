# Python and Cybersecurity

Everything within this specific folder is code and exercises that can be found in "Python For Cybersecurity" by Howard E.Poston III.

### Goal

The goal here is for me to get a better understanding of cybersecurity in both an offensive and defensive context and learning it hands on with sample scripts that are present in the book. Each script also comes with extra exercises within each section as a way to further develop my own understanding.
